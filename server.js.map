This is L20n's on-the-fly compiler.  It takes the AST produced by the parser\n// and uses it to create a set of JavaScript objects and functions representing\n// entities and macros and other expressions.\n//\n// The module defines a `Compiler` singleton with a single method: `compile`.\n// The result of the compilation is stored on the `entries` object passed as\n// the second argument to the `compile` function.  The third argument is\n// `globals`, an object whose properties provide information about the runtime\n// environment, e.g., the current hour, operating system etc.\n//\n// Main concepts\n// -------------\n//\n// **Entities** and **attributes** are objects which are publicly available.\n// Their `toString` method is designed to be used by the L20n context to get\n// a string value of the entity, given the context data passed to the method.\n//\n// All other symbols defined by the grammar are implemented as expression\n// functions.  The naming convention is:\n//\n//   - capitalized first letters denote **expressions constructors**, e.g.\n//   `PropertyExpression`.\n//   - camel-case denotes **expression functions** returned by the\n//   constructors, e.g. `propertyExpression`.\n//\n// ### Constructors\n//\n// The constructor is called for every node in the AST.  It stores the\n// components of the expression which are constant and do not depend on the\n// calling context (an example of the latter would be the data passed by the\n// developer to the `toString` method).\n//\n// ### Expression functions\n//\n// The constructor, when called, returns an expression function, which, in\n// turn, is called every time the expression needs to be evaluated.  The\n// evaluation call is context-dependend.  Every expression function takes two\n// mandatory arguments and one optional one:\n//\n// - `locals`, which stores the information about the currently evaluated\n// entity (`locals.__this__`).  It also stores the arguments passed to macros.\n// - `ctxdata`, which is an object with data passed to the context by the\n// developer.  The developer can define data on the context, or pass it on\n// a per-call basis.\n// - `key` (optional), which is a number or a string passed to a `HashLiteral`\n// expression denoting the member of the hash to return.  The member will be\n// another expression function which can then be evaluated further.\n//\n//\n// Bubbling up the new _current_ entity\n// ------------------------------------\n//\n// Every expression function returns an array [`newLocals`, `evaluatedValue`].\n// The reason for this, and in particular for returning `newLocals`, is\n// important for understanding how the compiler works.\n//\n// In most of the cases. `newLocals` will be the same as the original `locals`\n// passed to the expression function during the evaluation call.  In some\n// cases, however, `newLocals.__this__` will reference a different entity than\n// `locals.__this__` did.  On runtime, as the compiler traverses the AST and\n// goes deeper into individual branches, when it hits an `identifier` and\n// evaluates it to an entity, it needs to **bubble up** this find back to the\n// top expressions in the chain.  This is so that the evaluation of the\n// top-most expressions in the branch (root being at the very top of the tree)\n// takes into account the new value of `__this__`.\n//\n// To illustrate this point, consider the following example.\n//\n// Two entities, `brandName` and `about` are defined as such:\n//\n//     <brandName {\n//       short: \"Firefox\",\n//       long: \"Mozilla {{ ~ }}\"\n//     }>\n//     <about \"About {{ brandName.long }}\">\n//\n// Notice two `complexString`s: `about` references `brandName.long`, and\n// `brandName.long` references its own entity via `~`.  This `~` (meaning, the\n// current entity) must always reference `brandName`, even when called from\n// `about`.\n//\n// The AST for the `about` entity looks like this:\n//\n//     [Entity]\n//       .id[Identifier]\n//         .name[unicode \"about\"]\n//       .index\n//       .value[ComplexString]                      <1>\n//         .content\n//           [String]                               <2>\n//             .content[unicode \"About \"]\n//           [PropertyExpression]                   <3>\n//             .expression[Identifier]              <4>\n//               .name[unicode \"brandName\"]\n//             .property[Identifier]\n//               .name[unicode \"long\"]\n//             .computed[bool=False]\n//       .attrs\n//       .local[bool=False]\n//\n// During the compilation the compiler will walk the AST top-down to the\n// deepest terminal leaves and will use expression constructors to create\n// expression functions for the components.  For instance, for `about`'s value,\n// the compiler will call `ComplexString()` to create an expression function\n// `complexString` <1> which will be assigned to the entity's value. The\n// `ComplexString` construtor, before it returns the `complexString` <1>, will\n// in turn call other expression constructors to create `content`:\n// a `stringLiteral` and a `propertyExpression`.  The `PropertyExpression`\n// contructor will do the same, etc...\n//\n// When `entity.getString(ctxdata)` is called by a third-party code, we need to\n// resolve the whole `complexString` <1> to return a single string value.  This\n// is what **resolving** means and it involves some recursion.  On the other\n// hand, **evaluating** means _to call the expression once and use what it\n// returns_.\n//\n// The identifier expression sets `locals.__this__` to the current entity,\n// `about`, and tells the `complexString` <1> to _resolve_ itself.\n//\n// In order to resolve the `complexString` <1>, we start by resolving its first\n// member <2> to a string.  As we resolve deeper down, we bubble down `locals`\n// set by `toString`.  The first member of `content` turns out to simply be\n// a string that reads `About `.\n//\n// On to the second member, the propertyExpression <3>.  We bubble down\n// `locals` again and proceed to evaluate the `expression` field, which is an\n// `identifier`.  Note that we don't _resolve_ it to a string; we _evaluate_ it\n// to something that can be further used in other expressions, in this case, an\n// **entity** called `brandName`.\n//\n// Had we _resolved_ the `propertyExpression`, it would have resolve to\n// a string, and it would have been impossible to access the `long` member.\n// This leads us to an important concept:  the compiler _resolves_ expressions\n// when it expects a primitive value (a string, a number, a bool).  On the\n// other hand, it _evaluates_ expressions (calls them only once) when it needs\n// to work with them further, e.g. in order to access a member of the hash.\n//\n// This also explains why in the above example, once the compiler hits the\n// `brandName` identifier and changes the value of `locals.__this__` to the\n// `brandName` entity, this value doesn't bubble up all the way up to the\n// `about` entity.  All components of any `complexString` are _resolved_ by the\n// compiler until a primitive value is returned.
